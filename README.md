It will maybe be used on my [Wander game](https://github.com/Fabryz/wander), so I'm also experimenting with HTML5 Canvas.

What to do
----------

1- Download/clone the repository

2- Start the server with ``node server.js``

3- Point your browser to SERVER_IP:8080

4- Chat, draw, lurk and do a barrel roll

A working application is hosted on: [sawket.nodester.com](http://sawket.nodester.com/)
